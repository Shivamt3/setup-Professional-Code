# Setuppping a professional code 
- link for the data model diagram https://app.eraser.io/workspace/YtPqZ1VogxGy1jzIDkzj

# setting up the code and push on git 
- npm init
- making a md file of name setuppingCode.md

- Git work starts from here
1. git init (to initialize for the first time) => from this we are tracking all the files 
2. git add . (to add all the files)
3. git commit -m "this is our first message to commit our files"
4. to change branch to main branch => git branch -M main
"git branch" to check in which branch and
- now creating new repository in the github and giving the link of that so that the same would be changes and pushed by out code
5. setting remote 
git remote add origin https://github.com/Shivamt3/setup-Professional-Code.git
6. git status to check if any of the file needed commit or having changes
7. if having chnages then git add . ,then git commit -M "saving changes in readme file"
8. git push -u origin main => to push files to the github  (upstreaming is also done by this)

# Managing file folder everything (one by one and step by step)
- for uploading of images we will use third party services and before uploading them we will save them in our temporary folder. (in case of server lost or anything, we will have that temp file)
1. making a temp folder inside a public folder => public = temp
- here after creating the folder, if we check wether we have any status i.e. git status then it will show nothing as blank folders will not be uploaded on the github. 
- as many times we need empty folders to make our code structure complete, in that case we first make a .gitkeep file inside the temp folder and now that folder will be tracked by the github for changes, (.gitkeep is empty file)
2. .gitignore => files which we dont want to push on the git (git ignore generators are available on net to copy paste the file name directly)
3. .env => as we want not to push all the stuffs on github or on server for that we have this file .gitignore, in it we will mention all the imp parameters which we dont want to show to anyone. whenever we are pushing our code to server, to keep our system safe we put env files and these are not taken from file.
4. src folder => we keep all our files/work here
we will create three files inside it app.js constants.js index.js 
- we are making changes in package.json file, writing code so that we can use import statement
type : module
- we are using dependencies here, and we will use dev dependencies i.e. which we use at the time of development only, we will not take it to production.
- to use as a dev dependencies, we have to write.. 
npm install --save-dev nodemon or
npm install -D nodemon
- after installing we have to tell our system that after every save we will reload which file, for that we have to write some code inside package.json file.
- in script tag we have to write 
"dev" : "nodemon src/index.js"
now if we write npm run dev, our nodemon will initiate the index.js file
- there is a conflict between our type module and .env file because .env still takes require statement whereas we have mentioned that we will use type module. we will resolve this issue later.

-sending file to git
a. git add .
b. git commit -m "adding various files"
c. git push 

folder inside src => 
5. controllers => major functionality will we inside of this folder
6. db => db connection will be inside this
7. middlewares => code which we have to run in between to check or something ( eg to take cookies before sending data )
8. models => schema will be inside it
9. routes => till now we have written files inside it, now we will write different routes in different files
10. utils => shortcut to the utilities, we will mentuon code here which we will use again and agian
